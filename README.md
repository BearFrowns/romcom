## Welcome!

Welcome to our functional (and sultry) random romance novel cover generator! 

# What Does It Do?

This site gives users the ability to either randomly generate or make their own custom romance novel covers and even save their results!

Upon load up, the site will generate a random cover and the user will have four button at their disposal;
You may generate a new random cover with "Show New Random Cover", make your own custom cover with "Make Your Own Cover", save the currently selected cover with "Save" and even browse your *own* personal library of sultry novels with "View Saved Covers"!


## Make Your Own Cover! 
The user may enter a title, two descriptors and even a link to their favorite image to make it their own!
